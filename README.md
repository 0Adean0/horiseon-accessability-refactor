# horiseon-accessability-refactor PENN challenge 01

## Description

This is the initial assignment submitted by "AD" for Penn Full Stack Web Development. The initial assignments goals were to correct the .css and .html, provided in a completed sample project, to load, operate, and be user friendly with semantic .html and corresponding style.css. This was achieved though applying class/id classification to specific elements within the code and adhering to the their styling laws. Additionally, condensing .css classifications and their attributes if they shared identical measurements and metrics proved to "clean up" the style.css file.
